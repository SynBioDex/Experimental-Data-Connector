The Xperimental Data Connector (XDC) is a Python package that links excel2sbol and excel2flapjack, interlink the resulting data, and upload it to synbiohub and flapjack.

This branch is only used to generate an Excel sheet for experiments. It does this by taking the cartesian product of the options selected to generate an experiment that covers all possible variations of the experiment.
